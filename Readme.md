# Functionality
This mod adds mod-settings to forcefully make all non-boss/boss monster of any desired area types (combat/slayer/dungeons) a possible target for slayer tasks. (baring a few exceptions related to dungeons). 
It's important to note though, that monsters only found in dungeons will send you to the start of the dungeon!

If you are using Auto-Slayer, remember to think about whether your current setup will be able to deal with all possible slayer tasks of the respective difficulty!

# Mod compatibility
**Always go the safe route and create save files!** (For which you may want to take a look at the [SOS! Save Preserver](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/sos-save-preserver) mod)

This mod is somewhat incompatible with mods that add dungeons/monsters in the following cases (assuming mod setting configuration that would enable them as possible slayer targets):
* A fight you are meant to do manually, such as "Into the Mist" and "Throne of the Herald"
  * The worst result here would be that combat is being stopped or that you are killed
* Dungeons that use random monster selection, such as "Impending Darkness" and "Lair of the Spider Queen"
  * This may be able to outright throw an error, either while trying to select the "Random Monster" or while trying to calculate what to drop

As for the base game, monsters only available in the aforementioned dungeons are therefore excluded in the list of tasks you can be assigned, the only exception being the "Spider Queen" at the end of "Lair of the Spider Queen".
