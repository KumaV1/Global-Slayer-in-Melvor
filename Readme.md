# Functionality
This mod adds the ability to forcefully make all non-boss/boss monster 
of any desired area types (combat/slayer/dungeons) a possible target for slayer tasks. (baring a few exceptions related to dungeons)

# Mod compatibility
If a mod adds a dungeon similar to "Into the Mist", "Impending Darkness", "Lair of the Spider Queen" or "Throne of the Herald", then you might find yourself with a slayer task
which will either immediately stop your combat (e.g. "Into the Mist") or be non-completable due to how random-monster-selection is implemented.

And while I think those will be the worst things that could happen, always go the safe route and create save files!
